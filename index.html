    <h2>Setting summary:</h2>
    <p>Heavily inspired by star wars. Involves a mysterious crash landing in which the members of the ship awoke from carbonite not knowing what planet they inhabit currently or previously.</p>
    <p>The AI which they learned was controlling the ship instructed them to set up a shield until they were sufficiently settled to explore the intruiging planet.</p>
    <p>After some centuries of incubation, some members of the "city" were selected to go beyond the shield barrier to explore the world to the best of their capabilities.</p>
