Modern wielders use lances while mounted or driving open vehicles, such as cycle-riding raiders like the Vercite Rustrunners. Tactical lances are straightforward and widely available, while advanced lances are made of strong composites and have fine points to deal more damage. Elite lances have superfine points, and each has a particularly dense core for a more powerful strike.

Force fields bridge the gaps between the metal ribs, which give the armor the macabre look of a metal skeleton. Officers of the Corpse Fleet favor this armor for its unsettling appearance, but steelbones can be worn by anyone who values an intimidating style."),

A monolith suit looks like a massive articulated golem formed of stone plates. Despite its size, monolith armor moves easily thanks to its power-assisted joints.

When donned, mind mail floats just above the skin and alternates between rigidity and supple motion in response to its wearer’s thoughts and movement, with hundreds of tiny force fields filling the gaps between links as needed.  The mail covers the entire body except for the face. The coif retracts into the collar at a mental command, and the mesh gloves likewise unlink and recede into the sleeves when a delicate touch is required. Mind mail offers a comfortable alternative to climate control in tropical environs such as Castrovel, as the armor does not make direct contact with the body  and the open mesh provides ample airflow. The wearers of mind mail often personalize their armor with intricate designs woven with varicolored metals into the pattern of the mail.

It blends archaic armor sensibilities with cutting-edge technology, resulting in an appearance that resembles a metallic construct as much as armor. Night plate’s design incorporates flaring cauldrons and razor-sharp leg spurs, though these impressive adornments have little function beyond intimidation.

The kalo encounter suit represents the latest evolution of that design0a portable ocean that keeps the kalo at the near freezing temperatures they prefer. The suit’s air supply doubles as ballast to keep the wearer neutrally buoyant in water despite the armor’s weight, and the idiomatic design accommodates and protects the kalo’s swimming membranes. While the armor can be adapted to circulate water instead of air, kalos prefer their comfort of their own technology. Similarly, the filters and seals of kalo encounter suits can be adapted to the needs of air breathers, although such suits tend to accumulate excess moisture and develop mold or mildew."),

These toothy moltings are enormous, and once they’re retrieved, they require a great deal of effort to grind into plates that can be used to craft armor.
